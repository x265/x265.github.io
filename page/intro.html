	<p><strong>29/Jun/2014:</strong><br>Feel WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) too powerful until can't develop, downgrading to WinForms, and yet one video > one subtitle (one to one basis) for now, to avoid memory leaking and data not removed properly.</p>
	<p><strong>24/Jun/2014:</strong><br>Currently working on IFME version 4, using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation and trying to make less DLL!<br>Here UI working on...<br><img src="https://scontent-a-hkg.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/10411265_10203975201683309_3774720347262010669_n.jpg"></p>
	<p><strong>14/Jun/2014:</strong><br>Nothing much, however thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Aruuie" target="_blank">Aruuie</a> for the new mascot :3<br>I would like to thanks to who support this project, and use as benchmarking their OpenCL and CPU Instructions, I open some donation if you support this project!</p>
	<p><strong>03/Jun/2014:</strong><br>After a month, there are so many problem, with broken monitor all of sudden, and had to purchase new one, now I so broke, however I still continue working on this project!<br>I just updated IFME into latest version of x265 (1.0+139-a5998df9b12e) including dithering support, this allow colour loss undetected by normal eye, making it look smooth, useful when down sample to 8bit.</p>
	<p><strong>03/May/2014:</strong><br>IFME 3.2 has been released!<br>Now IFME no longer require to DECODE the video before encode to x265, this mean no longer require having large disk for temporary! yey!<br>However I fixed several issue which I found my self, DVDrip now de-interlaced. Oh boy, start using IFME 3.2 now! Have a nice day!</p>
	<p><strong>30/Apr/2014:</strong><br>I going to improve IFME that no longer require "Large Temporary Disk" and this could save time in great amount! I not sure when it can finished :)</p>
	<p><strong>29/Apr/2014:</strong><br>IFME now updated to x265 version (0.9+126-4f7658b3c78a), so far none I receive a complain. Since ImouCho (Anime) BD released, I decide to make experiment with my little Intel i5 2nd Gen CPU.</p>
	<p><strong>09/Apr/2014:</strong><br>IFME now updated to x265 version (0.9+19-b5caca9954f3) AND... <br>added one or more feature on Advance Tab, now you can RIP DVD (need to enable on Advance Tab) ALSO <br>capable to select one or multiple CPU Instruction Set! Good for fair CPU Benchmarking!</p>
	<p><strong>07/Apr/2014:</strong><br>Busy with life and work, still not to forget IFME, just now have compile error of x265 encoder (0.9), Wait another time let x265 team to fix it.</p>
	<p><strong>23/Feb/2014:</strong><br>Long time no update, it seem IFME stable for *now*, However, latest IFME updated to latest x265 encoder (0.7+289-734f106295df).</p>
	<p><strong>06/Feb/2014:</strong><br>Sorry for delay making update, due x265 code problem that prevent from compiling. Do some testing on Intel C++ 14 SP1 vs GCC 4.8.1 performance and speed test, GCC perform faster somehow!<br>x265 (0.7+59-def14c0234f5) 10bit getting faster also updated to latest Opus encoder and become default encoder for MKV (for new installation), IFME also get fixed several bug, now getting stable!</p>
	<p><strong>28/Jan/2014:</strong><br>IFME 3.1.0.2 released with support several font format for attachment, which is OpenType Font and Web Open Font Format, however also updated to latest x265 commit! Update and encode all your batch with many font attachment support!</p>
	<p><strong>19/Jan/2014:</strong><br>In same day, found bug and glitches that prevent MKV to processing.<br>When change language and add an font attachment, it will cause MKV not processing properly, and you will didn't get final encoded. Here IFME version 3.1.0.1 has been release for overcome this bug, advised always update to latest version!</p>
	<p><strong>19/Jan/2014:</strong><br>This is epic, now IFME 3.1 support multiple language support, having Chinese Simplified, Indonesian, Japanese, Malaysia and Norwegian, the list contribution author can be found <a href="about.html">here!!!</a> still have left more that need to add! Also not forget update to latest x265 commit!</p>
	<p><strong>11/Jan/2014:</strong><br>Glad to release IFME 3.0.0.3 with 10 bit or High Bit Depth, however IFME use force 8 bit encoding, because High Bit Depth not yet fully optimized for performance, however this can adjust by enable "Use auto detect" or forced 10 bit (will cause 8 bit input will encode into 10 bit). Thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/christoffer.boothby.71" target="_blank">Christoffer Boothby</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PureSlurpee" target="_blank">Danny Sabrak</a> for suggestion and problem report, IFME now getting better!</p>
	<p><strong>07/Jan/2014:</strong><br>Very fast update, IFME 3.0.0.2 now available to download, found glitch by looking at GUI (later on you know why), and fixed some code where queue time taken having missing how many day(s) taken. However, added new feature, encoder will highlight green in queue list where media done encoding, it's getting more to user friendly! See this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anime4000/IFME/master/installer/text_changelog.txt" target="_blank">change log</a> for more detail! <strong>By the way,</strong> I feel this website need to update, remove any irrelevant content and dumb content, may the a while to make-up this website...</p>
	<p><strong>05/Jan/2014:</strong><br>Good news! as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anime4049" target="_blank">Himari Noihara</a> suggestion, now you can add subtitle and font (attachment), this still under experiment, due limitation one subtitle per video and amount of video in queue must equal amount of subtitle on the list, more like 1:1 basis, but this new feature make work more easier! Installer now available!</p>
	<p><strong>04/Jan/2014:</strong><br>Starting version 3.0.0.1, IFME only available for 64bit to ensure speed and memory efficiency, also compiled under .NET Framework 4.0 environment, Windows 8 supported by default and Windows 7 user need to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718" target="_blank">.NET Framework 4.0</a> around 48.1 MB! Note that Windows XP are not supported.</p>
	<p><strong>01/Jan/2014:</strong><br>Happy new year!<br>Seem Intel compiler do compiling very wrong, making x265 detect wrong, however, from now x265 will compile using tdm-gcc 64bit.</p>
	<p><strong>28/Dec/2013:</strong><br>Intel said their compiler one most fastest then Microsoft VC and GCC, so I trying out, however, I thinking to release only 64-bit encoder, vote here (Facebook) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/myanimeclan/permalink/671913646192156/" target="_blank">64 vs 32 vs Both</a></p>
	<p><strong>24/Dec/2013:</strong><br>IFME 3.0 beta has been release! Rewrote code again!, added feature such as:
	<ul>
		<li>with better processing engine</li>
		<li>support multiple audio stream such as able to merge two or more audio.</li>
		<li>persistent settings, unlike before, every new version, need to re-setting.</li>
		<li>now with "IFME Output Terminal" (A command-prompt) to display all message and encoding processing!</li></p>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>23/Dec/2013:</strong><br>IFME v3 will release soon, around in Monday or Tuesday, touch some code and little housekeeping :) and improved updater program~ also need write the changelog, keep track what I change and update. I really hope this one useful encoder in the future!</p>
	<p><strong>09/Dec/2013:</strong><br>Ok! Now I working on version 3.0, maybe too early for that, but come with many feature's, however, currently I working, having a job on HP, as Computer Deployment (Desktop Management Project), I may not have much time to working on it, I'll keep trying to make as soon as possible, :) I promise... Coming soon, IFME 3.0! (I forgot to make change log...)</p>
